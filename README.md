# About

This script generates new images of cats using the technique of generative adversarial networks (GAN), as described in the paper by Goodfellow et al. The images are enhanced with the laplacian pyramid technique from Denton and Soumith Chintala et. al., implemented as a single G (generator) as described in the blog post by Anders Boesen Lindbo Larsen and Søren Kaae Sønderby. Most of the code is based on facebook's eyescream project. The script also uses code from other repositories for spatial transformers, weight initialization and LeakyReLUs.

- 3:  Enjoys all thoose marvellous Cat Generated rightfor u <3




***The following images were generated by networks trained with:***

    Model G32up, color: th train.lua --D_iterations=2. This model is currently not the default for G, i.e. must be manually activated in models.lua.
    Model G32up, grayscale: th train.lua --colorSpace="y". See above.
    Model G32up-c, color: th train.lua. This model is currently the default model/architecture for G.
